#Create a class InstaStory with a method share() that prints 'Sharing an image story'. Now create another class WhatsAppStory that overrides share() to print 'Sharing a text status'. Instantiate both and call share() to show method overriding in action.

class InstaStory:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    def share(self):
        print("Sharing an image story.")

class WhatsAppStory(InstaStory):
    def __init__(self):
        pass        
    def share(self):
        print("Sharing a text status.")

i=InstaStory()
w=WhatsAppStory()
i.share()
w.share()
